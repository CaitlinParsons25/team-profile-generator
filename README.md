# Team Profile Generator

## Description
Using inquirer, this Team Profile Generator uses command-line prompts to walk a user through generating an HTML file with their employees' information displayed. The four employee classes have been verified by tests run by jest, hopefully leading to minimal errors.

## Installation
Because this app operates from the command line, the user would need to download the code and the required packages.

## Usage
This app is meant to be used by businesses to generate an HTML page for their employee profiles.
